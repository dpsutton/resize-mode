;;; Commentary:
;; Easily allows you to resize windows. Rather than guessing that you
;; want `C-u 17 C-x {`, you could just press FFff, which enlarges 5
;; lines, then 5 lines, then one and then one. The idea is that the
;; normal motions n,p,f,b along with r for reset and w for cycling
;; windows allows for super simple resizing of windows. All of this is
;; inside of a while loop so that you don't have to invoke more chords
;; to resize again, but just keep using standard motions until you are
;; happy.

;; All of the work is done inside of resize-window. Its just a while
;; loop that keeps looping over character input until it doesn't
;; recognize an option or an allowable capital. The dispatch alist has
;; a character code to look for, a function to invoke, a string for
;; display and whether to match against capital letters. If so, it is
;; invoked with the default capital argument rather than the default
;; argument.
